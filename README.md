这是一段用python编写的中国跳棋的代码，也是我独立完成的第一个游戏，感谢我的老婆和朋友的测试。这个游戏的代码用到了pygame，跳棋的棋盘是用matplotlib编写的，单独存在board.py中。

"This is a piece of Chinese Checkers code written in Python, and it's the first game I've completed independently. I thank my wife and friends for testing it. The game code uses Pygame, and the checkerboard is written with Matplotlib, which is separately stored in board.py."

游戏的代码用到了minimax和alpha&beta剪枝方法。目前仅包含核心功能，即与ai对弈。ai考虑未来3步棋，但已经把我打得落花流水了……

"The game code uses the minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning method. Currently, it only includes the core functionality, which is playing against the AI. The AI considers the next three moves, but it already defeats me completely..."
